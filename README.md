# 207-project

On MarkUs for the "week3project" assignment (to appear after labs on Monday), your team will submit the URL to a public GitHub repo. It can be a new repo or you can start from the repo forked from the lab activity and just delete any files that aren’t relevant. Your repo needs to contain:

A readme.md file which must include:
a description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting to focus on in the project. (e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etc…)
a brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team is thinking of developing.
This is mostly just so we can give you some initial feedback on whether your team might want to reconsider your project direction.
a link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to the domain.
a screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like https://www.postman.com/ Links to an external site. or https://hoppscotch.io/ Links to an external site. Links to an external site.)
example output of running your Java code (see below).
a list of any technical problems blocking progress (if any)
please don't hesitate to ask such questions on Piazza too of course.
Java code:
A minimal example of calling the API from Java.
The output of the program should indicate the result of the request.
Tools like those above will generate code snippets for you, as will some API documentation pages. You can also refer to the code from the Grade API lab activity for examples using OkHttp.
All of your team members as collaborators for the repo.
Under settings, you can add collaborators.
Evaluation:
Your team is being assessed on:
Whether you have all required elements listed above.
The overall presentation of the information.
Your team is not being assessed on:
Whether you have gotten sample calls to the API fully working. Depending on the API, this might be more involved, so we just need to see a clear attempt by your team. Still include your code and screenshots of what you have attempted so far to earn credit.
