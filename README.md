### Summary of Project Domain: Social/Music

### API: Spotify

#### Our application does the following: 

- Users get a daily prompt, to which they can select a song as a response!
- For example, let's say the daily prompt for today is: "What is your go-to Christmas song?". The user will be able to answer this with a song of their choice. 
- Users can also post their response for their friends to view and like
- In addition, users can also listen to their songs on the app itself!

### Overview of Project Specifications: 

#### Users will have the ability to: 

- sign up/log in
- respond to prompts that are sent daily with a song of choice
- view their responses + response history
- delete responses to prompts (or prompt-response pairs)
- play short intervals of songs 

### User Stories: 

- Main User Story: User gets a Prompt on the Intro page > They will select a Song of choice to the Prompt > Then the User will be able to view that response, and their previous responses on their Main Page > They can also post the Response through their Main Page
